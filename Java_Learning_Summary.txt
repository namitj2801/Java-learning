           JAVA LEARNING SUMMARY
===============================================

This document summarizes the Java programming concepts learned through 
practical examples and exercises.

===============================================
1. BASIC PROGRAM STRUCTURE
===============================================

✓ Hello World Program (HelloWorld.java)
   - Basic class declaration: public class HelloWorld
   - Main method: public static void main(String[] args)
   - Output: System.out.println("Hello World")

✓ Simple Hello Program (Hello.java)
   - Variable declaration and initialization
   - Basic arithmetic operations
   - Output with concatenation

===============================================
2. VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES
===============================================

✓ Primitive Data Types (main.java)
   - int: for whole numbers (age = 21, year = 2025)
   - double: for decimal numbers (price = 19.99, gpa = 8.48, temperature = -12.5)
   - char: for single characters (grade = 'A', symbol = '!', currency = '$')
   - boolean: for true/false values (isStudent = true, forSale = false)
   - String: for text (name = "Namit Jain", email = "fake123@gmail.com")

✓ Variable Declaration and Assignment
   - Declaration: int age;
   - Assignment: age = 21;
   - Combined: int year = 2025;

===============================================
3. OUTPUT AND PRINTING
===============================================

✓ Print Methods
   - System.out.print(): prints without newline
   - System.out.println(): prints with newline
   - String concatenation with + operator
   - Escape sequences: \n for newline

✓ Comments
   - Single line: // This is a comment
   - Multi-line: /* This is a multi line comment */

===============================================
4. ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS
===============================================

✓ Basic Arithmetic Operators (artihematics.java)
   - Addition: +
   - Subtraction: -
   - Multiplication: *
   - Division: /
   - Modulus: %

✓ Augmented Assignment Operators
   - += (a += b is equivalent to a = a + b)
   - -=, *=, /=, %=

✓ Order of Operations (PEMDAS)
   - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction
   - Example: 3 + 4 * (7 - 5) / 2.0

===============================================
5. USER INPUT WITH SCANNER
===============================================

✓ Scanner Class (scanner.java, mad_libs.java, rectangle.java)
   - Import: import java.util.Scanner;
   - Creation: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
   - Methods:
     * scanner.nextLine() - for String input
     * scanner.nextInt() - for integer input
     * scanner.nextDouble() - for double input
     * scanner.nextBoolean() - for boolean input
   - Important: scanner.close() to free resources

✓ Practical Applications
   - User information collection
   - Interactive games (Mad Libs)
   - Mathematical calculations (rectangle area)

===============================================
6. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
===============================================

✓ If-Else Statements
   - Basic structure: if (condition) { ... } else { ... }
   - Boolean variable usage in conditions
   - Example: Checking if user is a student

===============================================
7. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING BASICS
===============================================

✓ Class Structure
   - Class declaration with public access modifier
   - Main method as entry point
   - Proper naming conventions

✓ Threading (PlayMusic.java)
   - Extending Thread class
   - Overriding run() method
   - Basic understanding of concurrent execution

===============================================
8. PRACTICAL PROJECTS COMPLETED
===============================================

✓ Hello World Program
   - First Java program
   - Basic output functionality

✓ Variable Demonstration
   - Comprehensive data type examples
   - String concatenation
   - Conditional logic

✓ Arithmetic Calculator
   - Mathematical operations
   - Operator precedence
   - Augmented assignments

✓ User Input System
   - Scanner implementation
   - Multiple data type inputs
   - Input validation concepts

✓ Mad Libs Game
   - Interactive storytelling
   - String manipulation
   - User engagement

✓ Rectangle Area Calculator
   - Mathematical application
   - Double precision handling
   - Real-world problem solving

✓ Music Player Simulation
   - Threading concepts
   - Loop structures
   - Basic concurrency
